  ## Description 
  When it comes to looking for a roommate wether for an apartment or a house, it is important to know if they would be a right fit. There have been many times where people have found a roommate through Cragslist or another way without proper vetting. With Rate Your Roommate, you will be able to see if the person you want to room with is in the site and what rating they got. Think of it as a sort of Yelp, but for finding a roommate. We learned as a group to incorporate routes, pure css framework, mysql and others. Our website is simple and has an easy user interface.
