  ## Description 
  When it comes to looking for a roommate, it is important to know if they would be the right fit. There have been many times where people have found a roommate through Cragslist or another way without proper vetting. With Rate Your Roommate, you will be able to see if the person you want to room with is the perfect fit through such information as where they currently room and some of their habits. Think of it as a sort of Yelp, but for finding a roommate. We learned as a group to incorporate routes, pure css framework, mysql and others. Our website is simple and has an easy user interface.
